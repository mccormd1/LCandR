# LCandR

Here are a few things I've made in R as my first commit to Github.

1. The lending club files involve filtering and modeling the default rate using several characteristics of the loans.
  modeling indicates that D grade loans offer the best reward:risk ratio, if you pick the right ones. the loan picker just
  filters the current loans based on some rough cutoffs, and then just ranks them listing highest APR at the top.
2. The normalize function just has a few different methods to normalize in it.
